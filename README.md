# Stack

- A simple Astro site, where the bulk of the content is here on GitHub

# Developing

1. `pnpm dev`

# Outstanding Issues

- Eventually, I'd like to return to hosting the blog content as dynamic pages. For now, I wanted to get on Astro and off of Ghost. It's probably a big post all its own, but let's just say when you type `pnpm start` and it doesn't because _checks notes_ sqlite3 is missing on a local install that runs differently from your production install, but you just wanted to edit your theme which needs to be a zip file and your dev cycle was to zip everything up, upload it, change the theme live and pray... yeah, I wanted to get off that.

# Bugs? Probably

You could file bugs. They'll be triaged. I file bugs against myself, if only so I remember something's broken.
